## Classes
**The main reason why CMU produces competent students - no other school has a curriculum of as much rigor as ours.**

# General advice:
- Take fewer classes
  * Spending more time on a class helps you gain a deeper understanding
  * Allows you to do other, more interesting, things
- Lectures aren't very useful, on average
  * Most CS classes have slides/videos
- Pick a minor that's not related to CS (cough cough math)
  * History
  * Architecture
  * Chemistry
  * If you want an SCS minor, I recommend Software Engineering

# Specific classes:
- 15-151
  * Quite hard if you don't have proof/competition math experience
  * Easy otherwise
- 15-122
  * Contracts/assertions will be a life saver in later classes
  * Algorithms are useful for coding interviews
- 15-150
  * A different way of thinking about how to code
- 15-251
  * Go to office hours to get answers
  * Have a good group
- 15-213
  * Learn software engineering/design

## Internships

- Generally hard to find internship as freshman
- Most companies want juniors so they can give return offer for full-time
- Probably want to spend at least one summer in the Bay Area if you want to go into tech

# Positive factors
- Previous internship at reputable company (Microsoft, MongoDB, etc.)
- Experience in open source projects (Linux kernel, Chromium, etc.)
- Referral
- Competitive programming experience
- Minority in tech: female, Hispanic, black, etc.
  * Microsoft Explore, Google EP, FB University
  * One possible career path is (replace FB with any other big company): FBU -> FB SWE internship -> FB SWE internship -> FB full-time. It is cushy, though I must note that I **do not recommend it**.

# Strategies
- Get referrals from upperclassmen friends, faculty, family friends, etc.
- Companies like Jane Street give interviews liberally, apply to them
- Go to Spark, the startup career fair
- If you plan to graduate in 3 years, say so on your resume
- Do research/take a summer off instead

# Commentary on companies
- Bigger companies like Facebook and Google tend to give less impactful projects to interns
- Medium-sized companies (Quora, MemSQL, etc.) tend to have decently mature internship programs but also be small enough to have interns work on nontrivial projects
- Smaller-sized companies are more varied and are mostly webdev or AI/ML

## Research

- Want to avoid doing busywork the entire time
  * Usually you will start off with some busywork and transition into actual research
- Hard to find actual research without having taken 200-level (and sometimes 400-level) classes
- Essential if you are interested in grad school

# Scenarios:
- I don't know what I want to do/what each area is like
  * Talk to your academic advisor
  * Just do something and find what you (don't) like
- I know which area I want to do
  * Go to talks
  * Browse professors and PhD students' websites
  * Go to professors' office hours
- I know exactly what I want to do
  * PhD students are usually much more responsive than professors

# Broad areas of research:
- Theory
  * Faculty are generally responsive to emails
  * Research Areas:
    + Algorithms: doing things fast
    + Complexity Theory: inherent limits of computation
- Systems
  * Faculty are less, but still somewhat resposive to emails
  * Research Areas:
    + Computer systems: computer architecture, runtime instrumentation, caching policy, etc.
    + Software systems: processing and storing big data, orchestrating many computers
- Logic
  * About formally proving things correct
- AI (CSD) /ML (MLD)
  * Professors are generally not responsive due to AI/ML being the hot thing right now
  * Better luck contacting PhD students
  * Generally more focused on theory
  * Research Areas:
    + Combinatorial Optimization: fair division, mechanism design, etc.
    + Theory of Learning
- LTI/RI
  * Professors are generally not responsive, see above
  * More focused on applications/alchemy of AI/ML
- Graphics
  * Fairly niche, has nice faculty like Keenan Crane
  * Nice if you're into that that kind of thing
- Security
  * CyLab
  * Research areas are diverse, some examples:
    + Breaking security mechanisms through clever signal sniffing
    + Formally prove information flow security in software
    + Iris recognition system
