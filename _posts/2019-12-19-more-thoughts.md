## TA'ing
- Material development, including but not limited to assignment and recitation development, is easily the most fulfilling part of TA'ing.

This often requires consultation with resources like the Eberly Center as well as veteran TAs and professors. It also requires quite a bit of teaching experience to understand what kind of pedagogical material works well with students.
