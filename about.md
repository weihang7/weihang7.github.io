Hello! I'm Weihang (Frank) Fan, a software engineer working at SambaNova Systems in Palo Alto, CA. I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Sonic Arts from Carnegie Mellon University in 2020.

One of my interests is pedagogical techniques for computer systems, including the development of programming languages for code specification in an educational context. 

Here is my [Resume](Resume.pdf).
