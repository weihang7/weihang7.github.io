Hello! I'm Frank (Weihang) Fan, a sophomore student studying Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. I will be a Teaching Assistant for 15-455 Undergraduate Complexity Theory this spring. My current research interests are in the analysis of HPC workloads and scheduling workflows in computing clusters.
