Hello! I'm Frank (Weihang) Fan, a senior studying Computer Science with a minor in Sonic Arts at Carnegie Mellon University.
My current interests are in pedagogical techniques for computer systems, including the development of programming languages for code specification in an educational context. I hope to one day do a PhD in those areas.

Here is my [Resume](Resume.pdf).
